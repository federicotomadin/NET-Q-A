# .NET Interview Questions

This readme file contains a list of commonly asked interview questions related to various aspects of .NET development. Use these questions to prepare for your interview and showcase your knowledge and experience in .NET.

## Basic .NET Knowledge
- **Q: What is .NET and what is its role in software development?**
    - .NET is a software framework developed by Microsoft that provides a platform for building and running applications across different operating systems. Its role in software development is to simplify the process of creating robust, secure, and scalable applications.

- **Q: Explain the Common Language Runtime (CLR) and its significance in .NET.**
    - The CLR is a key component of the .NET framework responsible for executing and managing applications written in different programming languages. It provides services like memory management, exception handling, security, and type safety, ensuring efficient and secure execution of applications.

## C# Language Proficiency
- **Q: Describe the differences between value types and reference types in C#.**
    - Value types hold the actual data and are stored on the stack, while reference types hold a reference to the data and are stored on the heap. Value types include primitive types and structures, while reference types include classes, interfaces, and delegates.

- **Q: What are nullable types, and when would you use them?**
    - Nullable types allow variables to have a value or be null. They are useful when dealing with scenarios where a value may or may not be present, such as database fields or optional parameters.

- **Q: Explain the concept of delegates and events in C#.**
    - Delegates are type-safe function pointers that allow methods to be passed as parameters or stored as variables. Events are a special type of delegates used for implementing the publisher-subscriber pattern, allowing objects to communicate and notify each other of specific actions or state changes.

## ASP.NET and Web Development
- **Q: What is ASP.NET, and how does it differ from ASP.NET Core?**
    - ASP.NET is a web development framework that allows building web applications using .NET. ASP.NET Core is the next iteration of ASP.NET, a cross-platform framework that is lightweight, modular, and optimized for modern web development.

- **Q: Explain the MVC (Model-View-Controller) architecture in ASP.NET.**
    - MVC is an architectural pattern for designing web applications. In ASP.NET MVC, the model represents the data, the view handles the presentation, and the controller manages the flow and interacts with both the model and view.

- **Q: Discuss the differences between ASP.NET Web Forms and ASP.NET MVC.**
    - ASP.NET Web Forms is an older framework that provides a more event-driven and stateful approach to web development. ASP.NET MVC, on the other hand, follows the MVC pattern, promotes separation of concerns, and provides more control over the HTML and client-side behavior.

## Database and Entity Framework
- **Q: How do you connect a .NET application to a database?**
    - ADO.NET provides various classes and libraries to connect to databases. Developers can use classes like SqlConnection and SqlCommand to establish connections and execute queries against the database.

- **Q: Explain the Entity Framework and its role in data access in .NET.**
    - Entity Framework is an Object-Relational Mapping (ORM) framework that simplifies data access in .NET applications. It allows developers to work with databases using object-oriented techniques, abstracting away the underlying database details.

- **Q: What is Code-First vs. Database-First development in Entity Framework?**
    - Code-First development involves creating the object model first and then generating the database schema based on the model. Database-First development, on the other hand, involves creating the database schema first and then generating the object model based on the schema.

## Dependency Injection and IoC Containers
- **Q: What is dependency injection, and why is it important in .NET development?**
    - Dependency injection is a design pattern that promotes loose coupling and modular design by allowing dependencies to be injected into an object from external sources. It improves testability, maintainability, and flexibility of the code.

- **Q: Can you name some popular IoC (Inversion of Control) containers used in .NET?**
    - Some popular IoC containers in .NET include Autofac, Ninject, Unity, and Simple Injector. These frameworks help manage object creation, lifetime, and injection of dependencies in a .NET application.

## Testing and Debugging
- **Q: How do you perform unit testing in .NET applications?**
    - Unit testing involves creating small, isolated tests for individual units of code. In .NET, frameworks like NUnit, xUnit, or MSTest can be used to write and execute unit tests, ensuring the correctness and reliability of the code.

- **Q: What is the purpose of the Debugger class in
